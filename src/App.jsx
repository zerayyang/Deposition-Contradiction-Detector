Deposition of Marcus Webb — March 14, 2023

Q: Where were you on the evening of November 3rd?
A: I was at home all evening. I ordered pizza around 7pm and watched TV.

Q: Did you speak to anyone that night?
A: No, I was alone. My wife was visiting her sister in Portland.

Q: What time did you go to sleep?
A: Around 10, maybe 10:30. I had work the next morning.

Q: Have you ever been to the Hargrove Street warehouse?
A: No, never. I don't even know where that is.

Q: Do you own a grey Honda Civic?
A: I did at the time, yes. I sold it in January.

Q: Had you met Daniel Cho before November 3rd?
A: No. I'd never heard of him before this whole thing started.

Deposition of Marcus Webb — September 9, 2023

Q: Walk me through the evening of November 3rd again.
A: I was home. I think I went out briefly to get some groceries, maybe around 7:30, but came right back.

Q: You mentioned last time you ordered pizza. Now you're saying groceries?
A: I might have done both. I don't remember exactly, it was almost a year ago.

Q: Did anyone see you that evening?
A: My neighbor, Tom, might have seen me. We waved or something in the parking lot.

Q: What time did you go to sleep?
A: It was late. Midnight maybe. I had trouble sleeping.

Q: Had you ever visited the Hargrove Street area?
A: I mean, I've driven through that part of town. I didn't say I'd never been in that general area.

Q: And Daniel Cho — did you know him?
A: I knew of him. We had mutual friends. I don't think I'd met him face to face.
